Thanks for taking an interest in my work!
I have experience programming for web applications and embedded systems. 
--- In the embedded directory there is a link to the GitHub repository for my group's work
    for CS 4501 - Wireless for the Internet of Things course, including our final project,
an NFC, Bluetooth, and WiFi based attendance tracker.
--- In the web directory there are links to my work, including a new website for Vermont Irrigation, 
    a site called Wastewatch, which is a Django based whistleblower platform for Environmental abuses.
    Please note that the site no longer supports image uploads because my group shut down our S3 bucket 
    over the summer. Lastly, there is a link to a repository containing my efforts to, for lack of a better
    word, cheat on the New York Times games. So far I have a program for Spelling Bee, and others are in the works!
